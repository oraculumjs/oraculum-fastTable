Oraculum is part application framework and part behavior library. The architecture can be thought of as two separate sets of components.
The application component of Oraculum is a set of `definition`s and `mixin`s that emulate the behaviors of Chaplin.
The behavior component of Oraculum is a set of `definition`s and `mixin`s that aims to solve some of Backbone's most common use cases.
