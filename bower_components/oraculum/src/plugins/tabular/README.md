Oraculum's Tabular plugin provides a set of `definition`s and `mixin`s that aim to solve the problems of rendering `collection`s as a two-dimensional array of `model`s (rows) and their `attributes` (columns) (eg, a table). It prescribes a set of patterns and interfaces that lean on Oraculum's built-in behaviors to provide this functionality in a configuration-driven way.
